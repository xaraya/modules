do that directly via SQL :

    // and still have the state 3 (= frontpage)
    $oldstate = 3;
    // will receive the new state 2 (= approved)
    $newstate = 2;

/*
If you put this in changestate.php and schedule that every day (or whatever)
those publications will "expire" automatically.

[Note : instead of the SQL, you can also use the getall() function to retrieve
the publications you want, and the update() function shown above to update
them individually.]

Some extension might be to "expire" only publications that were not published
by a certain author (e.g. yourself), or that are (not) in a certain category,
or whatever, but you get the idea :-)
