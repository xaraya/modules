        <xar:comment>

        </xar:comment>
        <ul>
            <li>Create categories for your forums.</li>
            <xar:comment>
            <li>
                <h4>Categories</h4>
                A couple of categories will have been created for you when you installed crispBB. Before creating forums, you might want to create categories for your forums, or rename the ones already there. Unless you have particular reason to, it's not recommended that you change the base category for crispBB once you have created forums, so if you don't want to take the default, now's the time to change it. You can add, edit, re-order and remove categories from the categories administration pages at any time. You can also re-order categories used by crispBB from the crispBB module itself.
