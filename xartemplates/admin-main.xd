<!-- Introduction -->
<h3><xar:mlstring>Overview</xar:mlstring></h3>
<xar:mlstring>
  <p>
    See the <a href="http://tikiwiki.org/tiki-index.php?page=GalaxiaWorkflow">introduction
    and user manual of Galaxia</a> for more details on what this
    module is all about, and how to use it.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, we clarify their definitions here a bit. In the workflow
    module a distinction could be made between:
    <ol>
      <li>The definition part: processes and activities</li>
      <li>The running part: instances and workitems</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    So, you <em>define</em> processes with activities and you
    <em>run</em> instances to complete workitems. During the use of
    the module you <em>Manage</em> processes and activities. There is
    functionality available to <em>monitor</em> all of processes, activities,
    instances and workitems. Each workitem can be completed by one or more process roles.
    In Xaraya, you map the users or groups in the roles module to these process roles.
    The description given here will be reflected in the Xaraya interface for the workflow module.

<!-- Getting started -->
<h3><xar:mlstring>Getting started</xar:mlstring></h3>
<p>
<xar:mlstring>
<ol>
  <li>
    make sure that the webserver can write to the directory
    <code>var/processes</code> (chmod 777 or equivalent)
  </li>
  <li>
    install <a href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/">GraphViz</a>
    if you want to generate some nice process graphs, and adapt
    GRAPHVIZ_DIR in <code>modules/workflow/tiki-setup.php</code> if necessary;
  </li>
  <li>
    go to the Dynamic Data <a href="index.php?module=dynamicdata&amp;type=util&amp;func=import">Import
    Object Definition</a> page and paste the content of the file 
    <a  href="modules/workflow/xardata/cdcollection3_dd.xml">cdcollection3_dd.xml</a>
    in the text area to create the sample database table;
  </li>
  <li>
    go to <a href="index.php?module=workflow&amp;type=admin&amp;func=processes">Admin Processes</a>
    and upload the file <a href="modules/workflow/xardata/cdcollection3.xml">cdcollection3.xml</a> to
    create a sample process;
  </li>
  <li>
    map some Xaraya users to the 'admin' and 'user' workflow roles for
    that process, or add all current users from a Xaraya group to one
    of the workflow roles [TODO: Galaxia does not support a permanent
    mapping between Xaraya groups and workflow roles at the moment]
  </li>
  <li>
    mark the process as <i>active</i> once you no longer have the
    errors "Role: ... is not mapped"
  </li>
  <li>
    go to the <a href="index.php?module=workflow">Workflow User Interface</a> and play around :-)
  </li>
  <li>
    come back here and try some of the monitoring and administration options
  </li>
  <li>
    create your own fancy processes and submit them back to the open source community
  </li>
</ol>
</xar:mlstring>
</p>

<xar:mlstring>
<p>Note: this is mostly a 1-to-1 conversion of the current Galaxia interface scripts from TikiWiki, and a quick &amp; dirty conversion of the templates that go with them. 
The sample CD Loan process has been modified a bit to be more representative of actual processes, but is otherwise unchanged.</p>

<p>With version 1.1, you can also automatically start a workflow process after some module item is created, updated or deleted. To try this out, you should :
<ol>
<li>upload the <a href="modules/workflow/xardata/review_articles.xml">review_articles.xml</a> file to create the Review Articles process</li>
<li>assign some users to the 'editors' workflow role and mark the process as active</li>
<li>enable the workflow hooks for articles</li>
<li>configure the workflow module so that the Review Articles - start activity is started when Create hooks are called from articles</li>
<li>create a new article and have fun...</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Version 1.3 adds the support for two BL tags : &lt;xar:workflow-activity activityId="123" ... /&gt; and &lt;xar:workflow-status ... /&gt;.
Those can be used in any template to run some workflow activity and show its output, resp. to show you the status of all the instances *you* started.
To try that out, you should :
<ol>
<li>delete your old "Music Loan 3" process, import the new version, assign users and mark as active</li>
<li>find out what the activityId of activity "Request CD" is, in that new process</li>
<li>in some template, add the following BL tags : &lt;xar:workflow-activity activityId="123"/&gt; (with 123 the activityId) and &lt;xar:workflow-status/&gt;</li>
<li>go to that page and enjoy...</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Version 1.4 also adds the BL tag &lt;xar:workflow-instances .../&gt; to show the instances that are assigned/accessible to you (i.e. your task list).</p>
