1. Extract and upload files under /modules directory (/netquery subdirectory).

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Access monitoring, screening and/or logging occurs ONLY on pages where the
  NQ monitor block is loaded and active.  To hide the block status from users,
  uncheck its "Visible" option in Netquery's main admin configuration panel.
- Netquery's local ping and traceroute features require read/execute permission
  for your system's ping and traceroute executables.
- If you have included the optional GeoIP and/or ports services and exploits data
  packages, be sure to select the "Install Data" options for those features and
  follow the on-screen instructions.
- All packages include two image sets of query selector buttons and several CSS
  stylesheets selectable as an admin option.  You can also "roll your own" CSS
  stylesheets.  Please see styles.txt for additonal important notes for Xaraya.

That's it -- enjoy!
