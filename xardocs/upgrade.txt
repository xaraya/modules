!!! IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPGRADES FROM EARLIER NETQUERY VERSIONS !!!

Because this version of Netquery relocates some CMS block functions (and uses
a Whois data table structure that differs from version 3.3 or earlier), it is
very important to follow the correct upgrade procedural sequence.

1) For all CMS editions (E107, phpFusion, Postnuke, Xaraya and Xoops) all
Netquery side blocks must be disbled and the deleted BEFORE the new version
files are uploaded to the server.  For the Xoops edition, this requires that
the module be uninstalled completely so the data table can be upgraded by the
new version.  Where applicable, the CMS template cache should also be cleared.

2) Upload the new files to your server, or upload the Netquery ZIP or GZ package
and extract the files on the server.  It is always safer to delete all of the
old version files first, rather than relying on overwrites.  In any case, be sure
to delete the nqmonitor.php file if one exists in the Netquery blocks subfolder.

3) For the standalone edition, just let nqsetup run as usual and it will upgrade
data tables as required.  For the Postnuke and Xaraya editions, run the normal
module update process from the CMS admin control panel and then re-activate the
module and any blocks.  For the Xoops and PHP-Fusion editions, this Netquery
version must be installed as if it were a new module, and then run the normal
Xoops module update process and reactivate any blocks as desired.

4) For the Xoops and PHP-Fusion editions, you will also need to re-install the
port services and/or GeoIP data tables by selecting those "Install Data" options
in the main Netquery admin configuration panel as desired.
