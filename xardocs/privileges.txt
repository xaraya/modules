Privileges for the xarpages module
==================================

The components are:

page            A page, identified by a unique ID and a non-unique name.
pagetype        A page itemtype, identified by a unique ID and a unique name.

The instances for the page component are (in order):

page_name       SELECT DISTINCT xar_name FROM [xar_]xarpages_pages
type_name       SELECT ame FROM [xar_]xarpages_types
page_id         ** SELECT id FROM [xar_]xarpages_pages
type_id         ** SELECT id FROM [xar_]xarpages_types
** not implemented

The instances for the pagetype component are (in order):

type_name       SELECT xar_name FROM [xar_]xarpages_types
type_id         ** SELECT id FROM [xar_]xarpages_types
** not implemented

The masks (with explicit user functions) for the page component are:

ACCESS_OVERVIEW 
ACCESS_READ     ReadPage        A page can be viewed (user display).
ACCESS_COMMENT  
ACCESS_MODERATE ModeratePage    Overview of pages allowed.
ACCESS_EDIT     EditPage        A page content and hooks can be changed.
ACCESS_ADD      AddPage         New pages can be added ++
ACCESS_DELETE   DeletePage      A page can be moved, renamed or removed completely.
ACCESS_ADMIN    AdminPage       Administer the module.
++ may have to think about AddPage a little more. A user may have AddPage priv
and be able to create a new page at any location, but then not be able to rename
or move it once created. I expect the DeletePage privilege will be more useful
then AddPage, i.e. EditPage is for an editor to manage content and DeletePage
is for an administrator to manage structure.

The masks for the pagetype component are:

ACCESS_OVERVIEW 
ACCESS_READ     
ACCESS_COMMENT  
ACCESS_MODERATE ModeratePagetype Overview of page type allowed.
ACCESS_EDIT     EditPagetype    Change description and hooks
ACCESS_ADD      
ACCESS_DELETE   
ACCESS_ADMIN    AdminPagetype   Page types can be added, deleted and renamed.


Note: if a user does not have privileges to add or delete a page, then they
should not be able to move or change the name of that page either.

TODO: do we really need the ID in the instances? Would the name alone be enough?

TODO: some things to make privileges in general easier to set up:-

1. Change the name of the function xarDefineInstance() to xarDefineComponent()
2. Allow the masks to take a comment field when registering. The database column
   already seems to be there. (Actually, this is done, but seldom used.)
3. Allow the instance query to return two columns: the displayed value and the
   returned value. An ID alone is often not enough.
